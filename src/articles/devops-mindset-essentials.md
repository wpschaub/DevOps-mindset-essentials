# Visualizing a DevOps Essentials Mindset

Organizations are investing in a move from resource optimized model, based on capital expenses (CAPEX), to a market optimised business model, based on operational expenses (OPEX). It's about **time to market** and continuously **delighting customers** with value! 

Welcome to digital transformations, embracing a **DevOps** mindset in your oganisation! 

As defined by [Donovan Brown](http://donovanbrown.com/post/what-is-devops), "DevOps is the union of **people**, **process**, and **products** to enable continuous delivery of value to our end users." 

> DevOps is not about magical unicorns and colorful rainbows. It's a journey of continuous learning and improvement, with a destination you never quite get to! It's the reason that all of the images herein, are based on the infinity symbol.

None of this is new to you, you're eager to explore DevOps, and probably asking yourself "**how do we get started?**" 

Being a visual minded person, I created a [presentation with posters](https://github.com/wpschaub/DevOps-mindset-essentials/presentations/devops-mindset-essentials-gdbc.pdf) to seek answers for the recently hosted [Global DevOps Bootcamp (GDBC)](https://globaldevopsbootcamp.com). It's an annual community driven event, hosted around the globe on the same day, to create an environment in which we can collaboratively explore digital transformations and DevOps insights.

Let's explore four of the quick reference [posters](https://github.com/wpschaub/devOps-mindset-essentials/posters), also referred to as visuals and infographics. For a more in-depth discussion of DevOps, refer to the [DevOps Handbook](XXX), by XXX, XXX, and XXX. 

## Practices

The first two posters are based on the [DevOps Assessment](https://aka.ms/devopsassessment) and intended to be used when reviewing the assessment results with all stakeholders. The first introduces five key **pactices**.

![DevOps Practices](_img/devops-mindset-essentials/devops-mindset-essentials-practices.png)

Top performers encourage a **culture** that fosters a growth mindset, reward innovation, collaboration, experimentation, learning, and user empathy. Strive for a **process** with a responsive application delivery, flexible scheduling, and iterative experiments. Monitor, identify and mitigate issues, and continuously elliminate wasteful bottlenecks. Only valuable key performance indicators are **measured** and used to strive for better **outcomes**, such as a low change failure rate (CFR), minimal time to recover (MTTR), and remediation of issues at root level. Lastly, **technology**, which is an enabler, is the focus of the next poster. 

## Technology

This poster is a companion of the **practices** poster and is focused on **technology**.

**Version control** cntrols versions of your application, configuration, infrastructure, and other code. It enables team collaboration and monitoring activities, such as deployments. Top performers use topic branches for short-term isolation, continuously merge changes into master, review and audit using Git pull requests, and version everything. **Testing** must be viewed as a continuous activity, embedded into both the developer workflow and the **continuous integration** (CI) and **continuous delivery** (CD) pipeline. The **Cloud** enables you to effectivey provision your **infrastructure** and move as fast as they need. Lastly, **monitoring** enables you to form a hypothesis, validate or disprove experiements, pro-actively detect issues as they occur, and understand the application health.

The blue bar on the right of the poster lists **products** to consider when you're investigation technology for your development, production, common engineering, and other environments. Provide feedback on the listed products and regularly update your poster to always have the latest of a volatile and opinionated part of the visual!

Which visuals you would like to see (innovate)? Which visuals add no value (deprecate)? Let's [collaborate](https://github.com/wpschaub/devOps-mindset-essentials) to facilitate visuals and guidance to help demistify DevOps and make you and your users shine! Users need a positive feeling that they can rely on proven practices, real-world learnings, and that they are not alone.

Looking forward to your feedback and pull requests!
