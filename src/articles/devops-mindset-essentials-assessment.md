# Start by assessing your DevOps mindset and performance

Organizations are under pressure to maintain a competitive advantage in an age where users demand relevant and high-quality solutions. Users are quick to switch solutions if the initial experience is poor, or time to market is slow. You snooze, you loose!

Adopting a [DevOps](http://donovanbrown.com/post/what-is-devops) mindset helps to increase profitability, improve productivity, deliver continuous value, and most importantly, delight end-users. However, the digital transformation is no trivial feat and introduces risk to the organization, teams, and individuals.

In the [DevOps Mindset Essentials](https://github.com/wpschaub/DevOps-mindset-essentials), we focus on five steps to get **getting started**, to continuously experiment, reflect, and adjust along the way.

You probably have a few questions, such as:

- How do you get started with your journey?
- How can you assess how you compare to the rest of the industry?

To mitigate risk to the business, explore the transformation in a pragmatic step-by-step journey ("peel an onion" vs "boil the ocean") starting with one or two teams, not the entire organization. They will eventually become the **lighthouse** to the rest of the organization, help promote the DevOps mindset, and enable others to transform.

To get started, begin with step 1 - **Assessment**.

Assessments benchmark you against the rest of the industry. They help you understand where you are doing well, where improvements are possible, and which capabilities to focus on. Two popular assessments are the [Dora](https://www.devops-survey.com/) and the free [Microsoft](https://aka.ms/devopsassessment) DevOps Assessments.

Get a view of how your leadership assess their organization (top down) and how the teams assess themselves (bottom up) by both completing one of the assessments, for example the [Microsoft](https://aka.ms/devopsassessment) DevOps assessment.

At a glance, there appears to be agreement with technology and version control. There is a divergence with Continuous Integration/Deployment (CI/CD), Cloud and Infrastructure, and Monitoring, which are clearly the areas of potential improvement. 

It is important to remember that these assessments provide a self-assessed snapshot and useful advice to innovate. There is no right or wrong, pass or fail result.
