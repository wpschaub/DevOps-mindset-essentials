### #9 - DevOps Practices

![Slide 9](_img/devops-mindset-essentials-gdbc/Slide9.PNG)

- CULTURE
  - Monitoring of running applications in production environments enables a DevOps team to detect issues as they occur, to mitigate the impact, and to understand the application health. Further monitoring of customer usage helps organizations form hypotheses and quickly validate or disprove experiments.
  - Top performers:
    - Foster a growth mindset.
    - Reward innovation 
    - Create a learning climate
    - Collaborate and experiment
    - User empathy
- PROCESS
  - The goal for modern application delivery is responsiveness, which relies on flexible scheduling, limiting work in process in favor of iterative experiments, and close team collaboration to facilitate real-time communication and eliminate wasteful handoffs. 
  - Top performers:
    - Go beyond cross-functional
    - Create multi-disciplinary teams
    - Allow autonomous teams to go fast
    - Align teams with enterprise objectives
    - Common product backlog
    - Minimize work in progress
    - Nimble and rigorous quality practices
- TECHNOLOGY
  - Products and technology are enablers, allowing teams and architects to focus on outcomes.
- MEASUREMENTS
  - Measurement is key to being able to assess performance and target improvement. Measurement allows you to see the state of the app in production, the flow from idea to code to delivery, and the actual usage of the features you produce. 
  - Key performance indicators:
    - Deployment frequency
    - Lead time for changes
    - Change failure rate
    - Time to recover 
- OUTCOMES
  - The point of DevOps is to achieve better outcomes. More frequent deployments allow you introduce new value more quickly. Higher deployment velocity gives you faster feedback on every change. Faster time to mitigate failures gives your users higher availability. More successful changes eliminate rework and let you go faster. All of these lead to more satisfied customers and more motivated employees.
  - Top performers:
    - Track live site incidents
    - Remediate at root cause level
    - Frequent deployments
    - Low change failure rate
    - Minimal time to recover

### #10 - DevOps Technology

![Slide 10](_img/devops-mindset-essentials-gdbc/Slide10.PNG)

- VERSION CONTROL
  - Version control enables teams located anywhere in the world to communicate effectively during daily development activities as well as to integrate with software development tools for monitoring activities such as deployments. 
  - Top performers:
    - Use topic branches for short-term isolation
    - Continuously merge changes into master
    - Review and audit using Git pull requests
    - Version everything
- TEST
  - Testing used to be a slow, infrequent activity. So slow, that testing cadence would determine a team's ability to release. DevOps strives for testing as a continuous activity, embedded into both the developer workflow and the pipeline used for continuous integration and continuous delivery
- CLOUD + INFRASTRUCTURE
  - Teams can use the Public and Hybrid Clouds to gain capacity on demand. With a well-managed cloud, your teams can provision resources as needed and move as fast as they need.
- CI / CD
  - Continuous Integration (CI) refers to the practice of triggering an automated build and test sequence with every commit of code changes. Continuous Delivery (CD) extends this to trigger further testing and the deployment to production, with approval if necessary. 
  - Top performers:
    - Enable teams to move features swiftly from idea into production
    - Create and validate release without impediments or manual rework.
- MONITORING
  - Monitoring of running applications in production environments enables a DevOps team to detect issues as they occur, to mitigate the impact, and to understand the application health. Further monitoring of customer usage helps organizations form hypotheses and quickly validate or disprove experiments.

### #11 - DevOps Habits

![Slide 11](_img/devops-mindset-essentials-gdbc/Slide11.PNG)

- Customer Focused
  - Listen to your users
  - Measure key performance indicators (KPI)
  - Progressively enable and disable features
  - Experiment to maximize learning and influence value
- Shift Left
  - Shift left on testing and security
  - Fast and reliable tests that run anywhere, by anyone, even in production
  - Enforce reviews, validation scanning, and approvals with git Pull Requests.
  - Stop feature work if team exceeds BUG CAP
  - CAP = engineers on team x 5
- Production First Mindset
  - Remediate at root cause level with designated response individuals (DRI)
  - Be transparent about issues, root cause, and resolution
  - Fine tune alerts to be actionable
  - No one-time fixes or commands – automate and version everything!
  - Rings to limit blast radius and deploy releases progressively
- Team Autonomy and Enterprise Alignment
  - Common cadence – heartbeat
  - Feature team owns feature from idea into production
  - Management owns WHAT + WHY we’re building
  - Engineering owns HOW we’re building features
  - Transparent collaboration
- Infrastrcuure as a Flexible Resource
  - Cloud and micro-services
  - Containerization to raise redundant and scalability, and lower cost
